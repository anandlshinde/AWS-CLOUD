What is an AWS edge location?

Edge location is a physical location where aws has its servers that are used to stores cdn caching. 
Edge locations are used to provide low latency access to the data. For example if you have your data stored in a S3 bucket that is in India,
but some percentage of your traffic is also coming from Austrelia/USA. 
In this case aws will store cache of your data in one of the Austrelia/USA edge locations so whenever request comes from Austrelia/USA 
it will be served from cache edge location that is in USA and request don't need to reach in India. 
Thus it will provide low latency access to your data and end users will have better experience.
